Before building a guest, be sure to run the setup script for your
system at scripts/util/setup-erb-*

ERB provides three targets (for now):

    make vm
    make vm-clean
    make vm-distclean

If BUILD_GUEST=ON (the default), then the vm target will be added to all. By default,
it downloads a linux kernel for the image. If you have a local development
copy, make sure to tell cmake about the path e.g.:

    cmake -DERB_LINUX_OVERRIDE=/path/to/linux ../hypervisor
